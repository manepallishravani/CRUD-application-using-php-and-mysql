# CRUD-application-using-php-and-mysql

This is simple CRUD Application in PHP & MySQL. CRUD stands for create, read, update and delete. Create means inserting data into database using INSERT SQL statement. Read means reading data from database using SELECT SQL statement. Update means updating records using UPDATE SQL query. Finally, Delete means deleting data from database using DELETE SQL statements.

Here I’m going to create four PHP files, each PHP file is for create, read, update, delete functions. And I’m creating a table with simple columns first_name, last_name, gender, age, email_id.

Using these four files, I’ll insert data into database (C), Reading data from database (R), Updating data in database (U), Deleting data from database (D).

And I’ll name these files in simple terminology

C – Create : index.php – To insert data into database (INSERT SQL Query).
R – Read : view.php – To read data from database (SELECT SQL Query).
U – Update : upate.php – To update data in database (UPDATE SQL Query).
D – Delete : delete.php – To delete data in database (DELETE SQL Query).
